/**
 * Graceful-shutdown budget
 *
 * How long server.js lets a shutdown run before forcing the exit. The number
 * has to satisfy two platform facts at once (Coordinator decision 2026-09-05,
 * option «б» — align the windows):
 *
 *   1. Railway sends SIGTERM to the previous deployment once the new one is
 *      Active and SIGKILLs it after RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_DRAINING_SECONDS — a
 *      service variable whose platform default is 0
 *      (docs.railway.com/reference/deployments, checked 2026-09-05). A timer
 *      that would fire after that kill is decoration.
 *   2. ocrJobPoller.stop() waits for the OCR job in flight, which is bounded
 *      by the stage timeouts (ocrService.JOB_DURATION_BOUND_MS, about 180 s).
 *      A job that dies with the container is left as a 'processing' zombie
 *      for the stale sweep about an hour later: back to the queue when its
 *      planned stop could mark it (ocrJobPoller.stop), failed for good
 *      otherwise — with the drain unset, no stop runs and nothing is marked.
 *
 * Resolution order (first match wins), never below MIN_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS
 * and never above MAX_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS:
 *   1. SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS — explicit override, milliseconds
 *   2. RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_DRAINING_SECONDS minus SHUTDOWN_SAFETY_MARGIN_MS —
 *      Railway injects service variables into the container, so the timer
 *      follows the platform setting without a code change
 *   3. DEFAULT_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS — the historical 30 s
 *
 * Pure: reads the env object it is given, never process.env, and returns
 * the warnings instead of logging them — server.js logs them at startup.
