/**
 * OCR Job Poller
 *
 * Background loop that periodically picks up pending OCR jobs from the database
 * and feeds them to the orchestrator. Serial processing (one job at a time) —
 * sufficient for Phase 1 volumes, easy to scale horizontally later by simply
 * running multiple pollers (FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED handles concurrency).
 *
 * Caveat before adding pollers: the batch-level partner notification in
 * ocrService (one menu_parsed per upload batch, 2026-09-04) relies on serial
 * processing — with several pollers two jobs of one establishment settling at
 * the same instant could both see "no active jobs left" and notify twice
 * (a duplicate, never silence). Serialise the check per establishment first.
 *
 * Stale-job sweep (reaper, 2026-09-04): a 'processing' row whose process died
 * mid-job (SIGKILL / OOM / redeploy without a graceful stop) is settled by
 * nobody — pickNextPending only takes 'pending' rows. Left alone it makes
 * ocrJobModel.enqueue treat the media as "already in flight" forever (re-run
 * OCR silently returns the zombie) and hides the establishment from the admin
 * "empty menus" signal. The sweep runs once at start() — the previous process
 * is the usual source of zombies — and then every STALE_SWEEP_INTERVAL_MS from
 * within the poll cycle, whether or not a job is in flight: a long backlog
 * must not starve it. Rows older than ocrJobModel.STALE_PROCESSING_INTERVAL go
 * back to 'pending' (attempts left) or to 'failed' (last attempt spent) under
 * the same retry rule as markFailed, and a permanent failure closes the upload
 * batch exactly as processJob does. The job in flight in this process is never
 * that old (the vision and structurer calls abort after 60 s and the PDF
 * download is bounded by undici's 300 s defaults — a live job stays far below
 * the interval; see STALE_PROCESSING_INTERVAL in the model), so the sweep and
 * the running job touch disjoint rows.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   - start() runs one sweep immediately and begins the polling interval
 *   - stop() stops new pickups and waits for the cycle in progress, the
 *     current job and the current sweep (if any) to finish — the job and the
 *     sweep both await the batch notification, so closePool() in server.js
 *     cannot cut it off
 *
 * The poller must NOT start in NODE_ENV=test — tests invoke ocrService.processJob
 * and sweepStaleJobs directly to avoid timing dependencies.
