/**
 * Favorite Service
 * 
 * This service implements all business logic for the favorites system.
 * It orchestrates database operations through the model layer, enforces
 * business rules, and handles error scenarios with appropriate messaging.
 * 
 * Architecture note: Services contain the "what" and "why" of application
 * behavior. They understand domain concepts and business rules but are
 * independent of HTTP concerns. Controllers call services, services call models.
 * 
 * The Favorites system is intentionally simple for MVP, focusing on core
 * functionality: add, remove, list, and check. More advanced features like
 * categories, notes, or sharing are deferred to post-MVP.

 * 1. Verify the establishment exists and is active
 * 2. Add the favorite (idempotent - no error if already exists)
 * 3. Return success confirmation
 * 
 * Idempotency is a key design principle here. If a user adds the same
 * establishment multiple times (e.g., due to double-clicks or network
 * retries), the operation succeeds without creating duplicates or returning
 * errors. This provides better UX than rejecting duplicate additions.
