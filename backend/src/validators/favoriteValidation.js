/**
 * Favorite Validation Rules
 * 
 * This module defines express-validator validation chains for favorites endpoints.
 * Validation middleware executes before controllers, ensuring only valid data
 * reaches business logic. This is the first line of defense against invalid input.
 * 
 * Architecture note: Validation serves multiple purposes:
 * 1. Security - Prevents malformed data from reaching database
 * 2. User experience - Provides clear error messages for invalid input
 * 3. Performance - Rejects bad requests early without wasting resources
 * 4. Data integrity - Ensures consistent data formats across the system
 * 
 * By catching problems early with clear error messages, we prevent wasted
 * processing and provide better user experience than letting database constraint
 * violations bubble up as generic errors.

 * Validation rules:
 * - establishment_id must be present (not empty after trimming)
 * - establishment_id must be a valid UUID format
 * 
 * We validate UUID format to catch obviously invalid inputs early. The

 * - establishment_ids must be present
 * - establishment_ids must be an array
 * - Array must not be empty (at least 1 ID)
 * - Array must not exceed 50 IDs (performance limit)
 * - Each element must be a valid UUID format
 * 
 * The 50-item limit prevents users from requesting status for hundreds or
 * thousands of establishments at once, which could cause performance issues.
 * This limit should be sufficient for reasonable use cases like checking
 * status for a page of search results.
 * 
 * Architecture note: We use custom validation logic here because express-validator's
 * array validation isn't as flexible for complex array element validation. The
 * custom validator allows us to validate both the array structure and individual
 * element formats with clear error messages.

/**
 * Validation error messages guide
 * 
 * The error messages in this module follow these principles:
 * 
 * 1. Be specific: "Rating must be between 1 and 5" rather than "Invalid rating"
 * 2. Be actionable: Tell users what to fix, not just what's wrong
 * 3. Be consistent: Use the same phrasing patterns across similar validations
 * 4. Be friendly: Avoid technical jargon in user-facing messages
 * 
 * Examples of good vs bad error messages:
 * 
 * Good: "Page must be a positive integer"
 * Bad: "Invalid page parameter"
 * 
 * Good: "establishment_ids must be an array with 1-50 items"
 * Bad: "Bad request"
 * 
 * Good: "Establishment ID must be a valid UUID"
 * Bad: "UUID validation failed"
 * 
 * These error messages appear in API responses and may be displayed to users
 * in the mobile app, so clarity and helpfulness are important.
