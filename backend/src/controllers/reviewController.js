 * requests, delegate to services, and format responses. Business logic lives in

 * This prevents users from impersonating other users by specifying different user_ids.

 * controller executes. By the time we reach this code, we know the data is valid.
 * 
 * The service layer handles all business logic including rate limiting, duplicate
 * detection, establishment verification, and aggregate updates. The controller
 * simply extracts data and formats the response.
