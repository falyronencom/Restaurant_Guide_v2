/**
 * Guard: every admin route is placed into an access tier.
 *
 * Why a static guard and not only HTTP tests: the split between `readAccess`
 * (admin + viewer) and `writeAccess` (admin only) is applied per route, by
 * hand, in adminRoutes.js. A new mutation registered with `readAccess` — or
 * with the old raw `authorize(['admin'])` on a GET — changes nothing in the
 * output of any existing HTTP test: those exercise one representative route
 * per group. The drift would surface only when a viewer pressed the button.
 *
 * So this test reads the route file itself and requires, for every
 * registered route: exactly one tier, and the tier that follows from the
 * method — GET reads, everything else acts — with an explicit allow-list for
 * reads that exist only to serve an action and therefore stay admin-only.
 *
 * How to switch it off without changing the run's output? Only by editing
 * the allow-list below, which is the point: the exception must be written
 * down next to the rule.
