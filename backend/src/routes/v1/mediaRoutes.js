/**
 * Media Routes
 * 
 * This module defines all media management API endpoints for partners,
 * composing controllers, validation middleware, authentication middleware,
 * and multer file upload middleware into complete request handling pipelines.
 * 
 * Architecture note: Routes are declarative specifications of how requests flow
 * through middleware chains. They should be readable as documentation of the API
 * surface without containing any logic themselves.
 * 
 * File Upload Configuration:
 * These routes use multer middleware to handle multipart/form-data uploads.
 * Multer processes the file upload and makes it available in req.file for
 * the controller to access. The configuration includes file size limits,
 * storage location, and filename generation.
 * 
 * All endpoints in this file are partner-only and require authentication.
 * The base path is /api/v1/partner/establishments/:id/media when mounted.

/**
 * Configure multer for file uploads
 * 
 * Multer handles multipart/form-data and saves uploaded files to a temporary
 * directory before they're processed and uploaded to Cloudinary.
 * 
 * Configuration:
 * - Storage: Disk storage in /tmp/uploads directory
 * - Filename: UUID-based to prevent conflicts
 * - File filter: Only allow image types (jpeg, jpg, png, webp, heic)
 * - Size limit: 10MB maximum per file
 * 
 * The files are stored temporarily and should be cleaned up after Cloudinary
 * upload completes. A cron job or periodic cleanup process should remove old
 * files from /tmp/uploads to prevent disk space issues.

 * - is_primary: Optional boolean (form field, default: false)

 * Flow: 
 * Authentication → Authorization → Multer Upload → Validation → Controller → Service
 * 
 * The upload.single('file') middleware expects the file to be uploaded with
 * the field name 'file' in the multipart form data.

 * Protected: Yes (partner role required, ownership verified in service layer)
