/**
 * Favorite Routes
 * 
 * This module defines all favorites-related API endpoints, composing controllers,
 * validation middleware, and authentication middleware into complete request
 * handling pipelines.
 * 
 * Architecture note: Routes are declarative specifications of how requests flow
 * through middleware chains. They should be readable as documentation of the API
 * surface without containing any logic themselves. Each route explicitly shows
 * all middleware applied in order, making the request flow transparent.
 * 
 * Middleware execution order is critical:
 * 1. Rate limiting (if applicable) - Prevent abuse before authentication
 * 2. Authentication - Verify JWT token and populate req.user
 * 3. Validation - Check request format and constraints
 * 4. Error formatting - Convert validation errors to API responses
 * 5. Controller - Handle business logic and return response
 * 
 * This order ensures efficient request processing: we reject unauthenticated
 * or invalid requests early without wasting resources on business logic.

/**
 * POST /api/v1/favorites
 * 
 * Add an establishment to user's favorites collection.
 * 
 * This is a protected endpoint requiring authentication because favorites are
 * user-specific personal data. The user ID comes from the JWT token, not from
 * the request body, ensuring users can only add to their own favorites.
 * 
 * Middleware chain:
 * 1. Authentication: Verify JWT token and attach user data to req.user
 * 2. Validation: Check establishment_id is present and valid UUID format
 * 3. Error formatting: Convert validation errors to structured API responses
 * 4. Controller: Execute business logic to create favorite
 * 
 * The operation is idempotent - adding the same establishment multiple times
 * produces the same result without errors. This provides better UX for scenarios
 * like double-clicks or network retries.
 * 
 * Request body:
 * {

 * 2. Validation: Check establishmentId path parameter is valid UUID format
 * 3. Error formatting: Convert validation errors to structured API responses
 * 4. Controller: Execute business logic to delete favorite
 * 
 * The operation is idempotent - removing a non-existent favorite succeeds
 * without error because the desired end state is achieved. If the favorite
 * doesn't exist, it still doesn't exist after the operation.

 * Check if a specific establishment is in user's favorites.
 * 
 * This is a protected endpoint requiring authentication because favorite status
 * is user-specific. Different users will have different favorite collections.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: This route must be defined BEFORE the DELETE /:establishmentId route
 * to prevent 'check' from being interpreted as an establishment ID. Route order
 * matters in Express - routes are matched top-to-bottom, and the first match wins.
 * 
 * Middleware chain:
 * 1. Authentication: Verify JWT token and attach user data to req.user
 * 2. Validation: Check establishmentId path parameter is valid UUID format
 * 3. Error formatting: Convert validation errors to structured API responses
 * 4. Controller: Check favorite status for the establishment

 * Batch check favorite status for multiple establishments.
 * 
 * This is a protected endpoint for efficiently checking favorite status across
 * multiple establishments in a single request. It's designed for use cases like
 * search results where the frontend needs to show favorite status for 10-20
 * establishments at once.
 * 
 * Middleware chain:
 * 1. Authentication: Verify JWT token and attach user data to req.user
 * 2. Validation: Check establishment_ids is array with 1-50 valid UUIDs
 * 3. Error formatting: Convert validation errors to structured API responses
 * 4. Controller: Check favorite status for all establishments

/**

 * but could be expanded to include breakdowns by city, category, average
 * ratings, etc.
 * 
 * OPTIONAL FEATURE: This endpoint is included for completeness but may not be
 * necessary for MVP. The basic functionality of add/remove/list favorites is
 * sufficient. This endpoint can be deferred if implementation timeline is tight.
 * 
 * Middleware chain:
 * 1. Authentication: Verify JWT token and attach user data to req.user
 * 2. Controller: Calculate and return statistics
 * 
 * No validation needed because this endpoint takes no parameters - everything
 * comes from the authenticated user context.

/**
 * Route ordering considerations
 * 
 * The order of route definitions matters in Express. Routes are matched from
 * top to bottom, and the first matching route handles the request. This is
 * particularly important for routes with similar patterns.
 * 
 * Correct order (what we have):
 * 1. POST / - Specific static route
 * 2. GET /check/:establishmentId - Specific prefix with parameter
 * 3. POST /check-batch - Specific static route
 * 4. GET /stats - Specific static route
 * 5. GET / - Specific static route
 * 6. DELETE /:establishmentId - Generic parameter route
 * 
 * If we put DELETE /:establishmentId before GET /check/:establishmentId,
 * then GET /check/uuid would match the DELETE route with 'check' as the
 * establishment ID, which would be wrong.
 * 
 * Best practice: Define more specific routes (with prefixes like 'check' or
 * 'stats') before generic parameter routes (like '/:id'). This ensures the
 * right handler processes each request.

/**
 * Future route additions
 * 
 * As the Favorites system evolves, these additional routes might be added:
 * 
 * GET /api/v1/favorites/by-city/:city
 * - Get favorites filtered by city for travel planning
 * 
 * GET /api/v1/favorites/by-category/:category
 * - Get favorites filtered by establishment category
 * 
 * POST /api/v1/favorites/reorder
 * - Allow users to manually order their favorites
 * 
 * POST /api/v1/favorites/:id/note
 * - Add personal notes to favorites (why saved, what to try)
 * 
 * These enhancements are explicitly deferred to post-MVP per the directive.
 * The current route set provides complete core functionality for bookmarking
 * establishments.
